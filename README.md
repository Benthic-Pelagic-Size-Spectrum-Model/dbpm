# dbpm - dynamic benthic pelagic model

This is a dynamic size spectrum model for modelling the coupling "pelagic" size-based predators 
and "benthic" detritivores that share a common resource pool (detritus).

This repository is a global application of dbpm for studying climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and 
potential fisheries as part of the Fish-MIP project and the Australian Research Council Discover Project "Rewiring Marine Foodwebs".

The model has been been developed through the following papers:

Please contact Julia Blanchard if you are interested in using this version of the model (which contains some new features), 
for more information or to get involved in further developments.
